## Cool Data Analysis Resources

I recently came across this fascinating video on [Youtube: What does data and analytics have to do with shoes?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uM-wHVZDyq0) that explains how data analytics is used in a major sporting brand, such as Nike. It's an excellent example of how data analysis can help inspire new ideas and trends for all professional athletes around the world! In addition, I found this [Harvard Article: Nike: It's Data Analytics, Just Do It](https://d3.harvard.edu/platform-digit/submission/nike-its-data-analytics-just-do-it/) that highlights the digital innovation and transformation used in the Nike brand.
