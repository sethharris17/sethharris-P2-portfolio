## JOAQUIN RAMIREZ CONTRIBUTED TO THIS EXERCISE

The structure below is one possible setup for a data analysis project (including the course project). For a manuscript, adjust as needed. You don't need to have exactly these sections, but the content covering those sections should be addressed.

This uses MS Word as output format. [See here](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/ms-word.html) for more information. You can switch to other formats, like html or pdf. See [the Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/) for other formats.

# Summary/Abstract

*Write a summary of your project.*

{{< pagebreak >}}

# Introduction

## General Background Information

*Provide enough background on your topic that others can understand the why and how of your analysis*

## Description of data and data source

*Describe what the data is, what it contains, where it is from, etc. Eventually this might be part of a methods section.* The exampledata.xlsx is the original dataset given. The dataset is composed of several variables, such as Height, Weight and Gender columns of a sample population. I added two more columns to the original dataset, one being numerical and the other being categorical. This data demonstrates data analysis that is used in R. My two added columns were WorkHoursPerWeek and EducationLevel to demonstrate the number of hours worked per week (numerical) and highest level of education attained (categorical) with the descriptions of my new variables being added in the Codebook sheet. I then saved it as exampledata2.xlsx.

## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed

*State the research questions you plan to answer with this analysis.*

To cite other work (important everywhere, but likely happens first in introduction), make sure your references are in the bibtex file specified in the YAML header above (here `dataanalysis_template_references.bib`) and have the right bibtex key. Then you can include like this:

Examples of reproducible research projects can for instance be found in [@mckay2020; @mckay2020a]

# Methods

*Describe your methods. That should describe the data, the cleaning processes, and the analysis approaches. You might want to provide a shorter description here and all the details in the supplement.*

## Data aquisition

*As applicable, explain where and how you got the data. If you directly import the data from an online source, you can combine this section with the next.*

## Data import and cleaning

*Write code that reads in the file and cleans it so it's ready for analysis. Since this will be fairly long code for most datasets, it might be a good idea to have it in one or several R scripts. If that is the case, explain here briefly what kind of cleaning/processing you do, and provide more details and well documented code somewhere (e.g. as supplement in a paper). All materials, including files that contain code, should be commented well so everyone can follow along.*

## Statistical analysis

*Explain anything related to your statistical analyses.*

# Results

## Exploratory/Descriptive analysis

*Use a combination of text/tables/figures to explore and describe your data. Show the most important descriptive results here. Additional ones should go in the supplement. Even more can be in the R and Quarto files that are part of your project.*

@tbl-summarytable shows a summary of the data.

Note the loading of the data providing a **relative** path using the `../../` notation. (Two dots means a folder up). You never want to specify an **absolute** path like `C:\ahandel\myproject\results\` because if you share this with someone, it won't work for them since they don't have that path. You can also use the `here` R package to create paths. See examples of that below. **I recommend the `here` package, but I'm showing the other approach here just in case you encounter it.**

```{r}
#| label: tbl-summarytable
#| tbl-cap: "Data summary table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable=readRDS("../../results/tables-files/summarytable.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable)
```

## Basic statistical analysis

*To get some further insight into your data, if reasonable you could compute simple statistics (e.g. simple models with 1 predictor) to look for associations between your outcome(s) and each individual predictor variable. Though note that unless you pre-specified the outcome and main exposure, any "p\<0.05 means statistical significance" interpretation is not valid.*

@fig-result shows a scatterplot figure produced by one of the R scripts.

```{r}
#| label: fig-result
#| fig-cap: "Height and weight stratified by gender."
#| echo: FALSE
knitr::include_graphics(here("starter-analysis-exercise","results","figures","height-weight-stratified.png"))
```

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(here)


#Path to data. Note the use of the here() package and not absolute paths
data_location <- here::here("starter-analysis-exercise","data","processed-data","processeddata2.rds")
#load data
mydata <- readRDS(data_location)

# Create a boxplot of Height by Education Level
p_boxplot <- ggplot(mydata, aes(x = EducationLevel, y = Height)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    title = "Boxplot of Height by Education Level",
    x = "Education Level",
    y = "Height"
  )

# Display the boxplot
print(p_boxplot)

# Save the boxplot to a file
ggsave("boxplot.png", plot = p_boxplot)

# Create a scatterplot with Weight on the x-axis and Work Hours Per Week on the y-axis
p_scatterplot <- ggplot(mydata, aes(x = Weight, y = WorkHoursPerWeek)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Scatterplot of Weight and Work Hours Per Week",
    x = "Weight",
    y = "Work Hours Per Week"
  )

# Display the scatterplot
print(p_scatterplot)

# Save the scatterplot to a file
ggsave("scatterplot.png", plot = p_scatterplot)


```

## Full analysis

*Use one or several suitable statistical/machine learning methods to analyze your data and to produce meaningful figures, tables, etc. This might again be code that is best placed in one or several separate R scripts that need to be well documented. You want the code to produce figures and data ready for display as tables, and save those. Then you load them here.*

Example @tbl-resulttable2 shows a summary of a linear model fit.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-resulttable2
#| tbl-cap: "Linear model fit table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable2 = readRDS(here("starter-analysis-exercise","results","tables-files","resulttable2.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable2)
```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-resulttable3
#| tbl-cap: "Another linear model fit table."
#| echo: FALSE
resulttable3 = readRDS(here("starter-analysis-exercise","results","tables-files","resulttable3.rds"))
knitr::kable(resulttable3)
```

# Discussion

## Summary and Interpretation

The boxplot shows that individuals with a Bachelor's degree tend to have the highest median height, followed by those with a Master's degree. Individuals with an Associate's degree have the lowest median height. There are also notable outliers among those with an Associate's degree. The categories "None" and "PhD" have very limited data, showing a narrower range of heights.

The scatterplot shows no linear relationship between the variables. Data points are scattered widely across the plot, indicating that weight does not consistently predict the number of work hours per week for the individuals in the dataset.

resulttable3.rds - output: The linear model fit table shows that the intercept is significant with a p-value of 0.034. However, none of the work hours per week predictors are statistically significant, with p-values ranging from 0.17 to 0.78, and the education level predictors were not included in the model due to missing data.

## Conclusions

*What are the main take-home messages?*

*Include citations in your Rmd file using bibtex, the list of references will automatically be placed at the end*

This paper [@leek2015] discusses types of analyses.

These papers [@mckay2020; @mckay2020a] are good examples of papers published using a fully reproducible setup similar to the one shown in this template.

Note that this cited reference will show up at the end of the document, the reference formatting is determined by the CSL file specified in the YAML header. Many more style files for almost any journal [are available](https://www.zotero.org/styles). You also specify the location of your bibtex reference file in the YAML. You can call your reference file anything you like, I just used the generic word `references.bib` but giving it a more descriptive name is probably better.
